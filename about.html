Not sure if this is an OK place to ask you questions, but is it ok to write the code using word wrap in VS code like I did here or is it better for me to manually break the lines for others to review in case they aren't using VScode?-->

					This is the Week 7 HTML project for the Front End Software Development
					Bootcamp. The project was inspired by a request from my son for a site
					about fingerboarding, and was created with the goal of showcasing my
					skills and knowledge in HTML. My name is Michael Varnell and I am
					excited to present this project, which showcases my ability to create
					websites and web pages using HTML only. This project is a testament to
					my dedication and hard work as a student in the Bootcamp, and I am
					proud to share it with you.
