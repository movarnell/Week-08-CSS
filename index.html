        <p> <img id="requiredID" src="https://stoysnetcdn.com/spin/spin6028815/spin6028815.jpg"></img>Fingerboarding is a type of miniature skateboarding that is performed using a small plastic skateboard deck, resembling a fingerboard, which is manipulated using the fingers. Fingerboarding is often used as a form of expression and creativity, with participants performing tricks and stunts similar to those performed on a real skateboard. The sport has developed a following and has even grown into a competitive scene with organized competitions and professional fingerboarders. </p>

Fingerboarding became popular among skateboarders as a way to practice and improve their skills when they were unable to access a full-sized skateboard or skatepark.</p>
        
        
       <p>In the 1990s and 2000s, fingerboarding evolved into its own subculture, with dedicated fingerboard companies producing specialized fingerboard gear and accessories. Competitive fingerboarding events also started to emerge, where fingerboarders could showcase their tricks and skills to a wider audience. Today, fingerboarding continues to be a popular hobby and sport, with a large and dedicated community of enthusiasts around the world.</p>
